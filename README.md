Password Generator

In this homework assignment we were tasked with adding the logic to an existing shell of an app.
The app in question is a password generator which prompts the user to choose from the following options:

-Length of password - Between 8 and 128 characters.
-Letter case: Uppercase, lowercase or both.
-Special characters: "~!%$&@^%#" and so on.

After each of these parameters have been decided upon, the user will get a password generated and ready to copy+paste from the text field!

So a password of the user's choice of number of characters between 8 and 128,
if the password will be upper, lower cases or both (hey or neither!),
special characters too and viola! Thank you :D
